# AnsaliteUI
A user interactive web UI aimed at providing all the tools necessary to utilize Ansible/Salt, including all the features available through the CLI. Gunicorn + Flask has been selected for the web hosting, and with that comes a Python backend, which seems appropriate for the sole reason that both Ansible and Salt are built with Python. The primary goal for now is a frontend for Salt, with the additional aim of building an appropriate frontend for Ansible as well.
